BSO works structurally differently than the other models in this package. It
stochastically simulates a multitude of individuals instead of only returning a result for
one representative beetle. Additionally, it requires an hourly onset to function. This is why
the BSO-specific phenology function `bso_phenology()` exists. While it is still
possible to combine the diapause and the mortality submodels with other models,
this is not the case for the onset and development submodels.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(barrks)
library(tidyverse)
library(terra)


# function to unify the appearance of raster plots
my_rst_plot <- function(rst) {
  plot(rst, mar = c(0.2, 0.1, 2, 5),
       axes = FALSE, box = TRUE, nr = 1,
       cex.main = 1.9, plg = list(cex = 1.8))
}


pheno_bso <- bso_phenology('bso', barrks_data())

```


# BSO-specific plots

As `bso_phenology()` returns a more detailed result than `phenology()`, a few
more functions are available for illustration.
The stage diagram illustrates the share of the total individuals
at a specific developmental stage.


```{r bso-stage-diagram, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.dim=c(12,6), fig.cap = "BSO stage diagram (the different colors represent the respective generation, generation '0' stands for the hibernating beetles)"}

station <- stations_create('station 1', 234)

bso_plot_stage_diagram(pheno_bso, station)
```

The flight diagram shows the relative flight activity at a specific date.

```{r bso-flight-diagram, message = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.dim=c(12,6), fig.cap = "BSO flight diagram (the colors describe which generation flies to establish a new filial generation or a sister brood respectively)"}
bso_plot_flight_diagram(pheno_bso, station)
```



# Standard outputs

With `bso_translate_phenology()` it is possible to translate the BSO-specific
phenology to a form that corresponds to the output of `phenology()`.
This makes it possible to use functions that are available to analyse phenology
objects.

```{r bso-gens, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.dim=c(14, 3), fig.cap = "Generations calculated by BSO"}

pheno_translated <- bso_translate_phenology(pheno_bso)

dates <- c('2015-04-15', '2015-06-15', '2015-08-15', '2015-10-15')
get_generations_rst(pheno_translated, dates) %>% my_rst_plot()

```
